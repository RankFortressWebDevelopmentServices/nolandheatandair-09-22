                    Change your furnace filter regularly:

                <p>
                    A dirty furnace filter can <a href="https://www.nolandheatandair.com/furnace-repair-cabot-ar/">restrict airflow and cause your furnace</a> to work harder than it needs to, which can end up costing you more money in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid this, checking and cleaning your furnace filter regularly is essential. Depending on your filter type, you may need to do this every few months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re unsure how to clean your furnace filter, don’t worry – it’s easy! Just follow these simple steps:

                    <li>
                        Vacuum or brush away any debris from the surface of the filter. If it’s filthy, you may need to soak it in hot water and soap to loosen the dirt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rinse the filter with clean water and allow it to air dry completely before putting it back in the housing.

                    Don't use extension cords:

                <br>
                <p>
                    If you need to plug something into an outlet near your furnace, use a heavy-duty extension cord rated for the amperage of your furnace. Never use a lighter-gauge cord, as it could overheat and start a fire. We also recommend surge protectors; give us a call and we’ll get that set up for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a natural gas or propane furnace, you’ll also need to have it serviced regularly by a professional. This is because these furnaces can build up deadly carbon monoxide gas. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions on how often your furnace is serviced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have an <a href="https://www.nolandheatandair.com/what-do-you-need-to-know-about-ac-repair-in-pangburn-ar/">electric furnace</a>, you should still have it serviced regularly. Electric furnaces can also develop problems, such as a short circuit.

                            You should be doing this regularly anyway, but it’s essential to do it before you start using your furnace for the season. Make sure that all of the detectors in your home are working correctly and have fresh batteries. This includes your smoke detector, your carbon monoxide detector, and any other detectors that you have in your home. You should also have a fire extinguisher on hand, just in case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thing to do before you start using your furnace is to clean it. You can hire a professional to do this for you or do it yourself if you feel comfortable doing so. Just make sure that you unplug the furnace before you start cleaning it.

                    You should also look at your ductwork and ensure no leaks or holes. If there are, you’ll want to seal them up so that heat doesn’t escape your home. These are just a few of the things that you should do before you start using your furnace for the season. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure that your furnace runs efficiently and doesn’t cause any problems.
